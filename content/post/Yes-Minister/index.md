I wonder if I might crave your momentary indulgence in order to discharge a by no means disagreeable obligation, which has over the years become more or less established practice within government circles as we approach the terminal period of the year, counting, of course, not financial, in fact, not to put too fine a point on it, week 51. And submit to you, with all appropriate deference, for your consideration at a convenient junction, a sincere and sanguine expectation, indeed confidence, indeed, one might go so far as to say, hope, that the aforementioned period may be at the end of the day, when all relevant factors have been taken into consideration, susceptible of being deemed to be such as to merit a final verdict of having been by no means unsatisfactory in its overall outcome, and in the final analysis to give grounds for being judged, on mature reflection, to have been conductive to generating a degree of gratification which will be seen in retrospect to have been significantly higher than the general average.
