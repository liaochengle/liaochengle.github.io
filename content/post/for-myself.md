### I
I'm fifteen, almost sixteen, I've finally decided to start writing a blog--though it's really more of a personal journal for me than anything else. I've realized that I want to capture who I am right now, at this moment. Sometimes, I'm not sure if I miss the past itself, or it I miss who I was in the past. 
I know I'm still young, still in these formative years, but I feel like I've already gone through so many experiences, which I am more than willing to share in the future, that changed me in ways I didn't expect

### II
I have family I didn't see for seven years--my closest two nephews. It's strange to think that time can stretch out so much between people who once felt inseparable. I reunited with one of my nephews last year by chance, and it filled me with this odd mix of happiness and fear. 
The reason for that fear finally clicked in my mind: he knew me as I used to be, and she'd see how I've changed. According to her, I'm a better person now. But despite hearing that, I can't shake off a sense of unease. I think it's because there's part of me that still clings to the girl I was before all of life's complications arrived.

### III
That girl had her flaws--she wasn't always kind or mature, and people might've disliked her for being childish. But she also didn't carry so many burdens. She believed, without question, that hose she cared about loved her deeply and unconditionally.
I miss living in that sense of certainty. Now, it feels like I'm more aware of how fragile love and closeness can be, and that awareness makes me nostalgic for the time when I took those bonds for granted.
It's not that I want to dismiss the ways I've grown--because I do appreciate them. I'm happy to be more thoughtful, more considerate in some ares. But I can't help missing the carefree assurance I had, that unshakable belief in forever. I miss the people from that time, too, as we all existed in that world together, and I can't fully go back there anymore, not even in my mind

### IV
It's strange kind of loss: mourning a version of myself and the people who surrounded me back then.
I guess that's why I'm writing this. I want to record these thoughts--unfiltered, just for me and you, potential readers--so I can look back on them on day and remember how it felt. This is me being completely honest with myself, admitting that yes, I'm afraid, that I'm growing, and that growth sometimes hurts. 
Maybe, in sharing these words (even if only with myself), I'll be able to see more clearly where I've been and where I'm going. And maybe, someday, I'll find some peace with the girl I used to be and the person I'm becoming. 
For now, I just want to say: I miss her. I miss them. I miss all of it. And that's okay.
