***Happy Valentine's Day***


I can fly across half of the earth to wish you a happy birthday, but I am not entitled to say "happy valentine's day"

I loved you:  yet the love, maybe,    
Has not extinguished in my heart;     
But hence may not it trouble thee;    
I do not want to make you sad.    
I loved you hopelessly and mutely,    
Now with shyness, now with jealousy being vexed;    
I loved you so sincerely, so fondly,     
Likewise may someone love you next.  
	- Alexander Pushkin
