### Invisible Scars: Growing Up Under Emotional Abuse

There are so many thoughts racing through my mind, countless emotions battling to be expressed, acknowledged, validated. I sometimes wonder about God—though I don't quite believe in one, who truly knows the future? But if a deity does exist, mathematics surely must be their language.

She accused me recently of seeing only the faults in others, blind to my own flaws. Ironically, she never notices any good in me, fixated only on my perceived mistakes. Perhaps she should have had another child, someone truly problematic, to realize how fortunate she was with me.

Her method of arguing is nothing short of psychological warfare—brilliant, if viewed objectively. She fabricates "evidence," inflating incidents tenfold to suit her narrative. Her arrogance surpasses reason; she listens only to herself, disregarding any explanation I offer. The moment she finds a sliver of ammunition against me, she relentlessly attacks, silencing my voice, suffocating my defense. If I dare protest, she dismisses my frustration as a misunderstanding, though we both know her intent. She's mastered the cruel art of emotional torment, turning every conversation into a trap from which I cannot escape.

Her abuse is entirely psychological, invisible to outsiders. Physical scars can be seen, acknowledged, validated. Emotional scars? They remain hidden, dismissed. When I've dared to express my pain, others suggest that I'm overly sensitive, too fragile. But perhaps one thing I should thank her for is toughening my skin—I've grown accustomed to this emotional siege, preparing me for a future where no one's words can wound me deeply again.

She hoards her "evidence," secretly, patiently. She observes my mistakes without guidance, without correction, silently cataloging each one. Then, in a moment of confrontation, she unleashes accusations of repeated offenses, amplifying the hurt with exaggerated claims. Her goal isn't correction, it's domination. Her moral high ground is always secure, her self-righteousness absolute.

I don't need therapy; I need distance. Separation. Freedom. I will achieve success, fame, wealth—without any credit owed to her. When I marry, only my sister will know. If I ever leave this world by my own hand, it will be my sister alone who receives my final words. My mother has become no more significant than a stranger to me.

Yet, I don't harbor hatred. Hatred is a privilege reserved for those we've deeply loved, and she doesn't deserve such emotion from me. Indifference will be my shield. I will maintain civility, polite detachment, empty interactions that she'll likely never notice. My aim isn't to hurt her or anger her—it is simply to sever ties, to move forward unburdened.

I've abandoned any naïve hopes of unconditional love. My mother taught me the price of trust, a lesson burned deep into my consciousness. There will be no trust freely given, no vulnerability foolishly shared.

My blog has become my only sanctuary—the one place where honesty flows unrestrained, genuine, and completely transparent. Here, and only here, am I truly myself.

### Lessons Learned:

- Adopt egotistical utilitarianism: Protect yourself first and always.
- When facing authority—be it your mother now or your boss in the future—respond with neutrality, devoid of emotion, allowing them to bear the consequences of their decisions.
- Keep your opinions hidden, share no secrets with those who weaponize your honesty against you.
- Responsibility is burdensome—embrace detachment to preserve your peace.
