***Happy Valentine's Day***

### **I**

I could fly across half the world, just to offer you “happy birthday.”  
Yet something binds my lips,  and I cannot whisper, “happy Valentine’s Day.”  

---

### **II**

I loved you:  yet the love, maybe,    
Has not extinguished in my heart;     
But hence may not it trouble thee;    
I do not want to make you sad.    
I loved you hopelessly and mutely,    
Now with shyness, now with jealousy being vexed;    
I loved you so sincerely, so fondly,     
Likewise may someone love you next.

---

### **III**

Do I entice you?   
Do I speak you fair?  
Or, rather, do I not in the plainest truth tell you   
I do not nor I cannot love you. 

---

### **IV**

It has been four years since we last spoke, and yet you remain vividly real. Your face rises before me at the quietest moments. I can pick you out of a crowd in the blurriest of photographs that I purposedly found on your school crimson, even though I cannot recognize anyone else. I remember your walk, the way you wrote on the page, the tone of your voice—every detail. It feels foolish, doesn’t it? Worse still, there was a time I dated someone simply because he bore the slightest resemblance to you, and that was enough to captivate me. 

If fate ever lets us meet again, I don't know how I will behave. I imagine myself inviting you to lunch in some hidden corner of the city, or asking if you’d like to see *Oppenheimer* with me. Maybe we would talk about our middle school days: I’d want to hear all that has happened to you since we graduated four years ago. Maybe I would dare to share my own stories. Or maybe we would simply sit together on a bench, both wordless but comforted by each other’s presence.  

As I look to September 2025, I hope for a chance to meet you. But whether or not that happens, it is time for me to let you go. I have loved you—quietly, hopelessly, and with all the sincerity of a teenager’s heart. After September, this quiet longing will fade into the past, and no one will ever be bothered by this short, little story anymore.

I write this letter in the open, where it will always be yours to find, should you stumble upon my words. It may be an echo of the girl I was, with all her earnest, overwhelming emotion. But for now, these words belong to you, just as my heart once did.  

Never because I stopped loving you.

*With genuine affection and one last confession,*  
**Me**
